# JetsonBot
Autonomous Object Tracking Car 

The purpose of this project was to combine multiple technologies into an autonomous object tracking car. The main two hardware components used were Nvidia's Jetson Nano and an Arduino developer board. The software used was written in Python 3.6 and utilized both OpenCv and the pyfiramta library (provided by Arduino). The car is currently able to lock onto a target of a specified color and follow that target until a certain proximity. A custom gimbal made from 2 servos allow a 2-axis rotation for the Arducam camera so that a full 2-axis object tracking can take place.
